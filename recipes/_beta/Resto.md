## Method

To start chop the chicken thighs into cubes and add them to a bowl with the chile powder, ground cumin, garam masala powder, salt, crushed garlic, ginger, lime, and yogurt. Mix to combine and set aside for 15 minutes to let marinate. When ready to cook, set a cast iron on medium-high heat, add oil, and sear pieces until browned and cooked through.

For the gravy, melt the butter to a pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute for 2-3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cashews, garlic, ginger, garam masala, chile powder, a small pinch of salt, and a sprinkle of turmeric. Let cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add some water and stir to combine.

Pour the sauce into a food processor, or blender and pulse until completely smooth. Over the pan, pour and push the sauce through a metal strainer back to the pan. Turn the heat on medium. Add the butter, heavy cream, and cooked chicken. Stir the sauce and let simmer until it slightly thickens, about 6-8 minutes. Crush the toasted kasoor methi between your hands sprinkle over top.

Serve the butter chicken with rice, naan, or vegetables. Garnish with cilantro and some drops of more cream.
