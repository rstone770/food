## Ingredients
* 2 lbs of shrimp peeled and deveined (frozen or fresh)
* 1.5 lbs small red potatoes quartered
* 1 lb smoked sausage, cut into 1" chunks
* 4 ears of corn broken into 3-4 pieces each.
* 6 cloves of garlic smashed
* 1 lemon quartered
* 1 onion peeled and cut into 4-8 pieces.

  + I love Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, about 4 oz will work. The alcohol will dissolve flavors(oils in the spices) and make the flavors more intense as well as add its own mix of flavors to the dish such as caramel and vanilla.
  + A good quality beer will also work, I prefer something with strong citrus or hop flavors such as juicy/hazy IPAs.

## Instructions

1. In a large pot combine 3 quarts(2800ml) of water, beer, lemon, onion, garlic, salt, pepper flakes, and the crawfish boil seasoning. Bring to boil.

2. Add potatoes and boil for 10-12 minutes. Potatoes should be just tender.

3. Add sausage and corn. Cook for another 3-4 minutes.

4. Add shrimp. Cook for 2-3 minutes, they should be pink and opaque. 
  + If frozen, stir in the shrimp and bring to a simmer for a minute or two. The soaking will cook the shrimp through.

5. Remove off heat and let soak for 15-20 minutes.

6. Reserve 1-2 cups of brine and drain boil.

7. Whisk butter into the brine reserve and pour over the remaining mixture. Stir and serve.
