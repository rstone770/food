## Instructions

1. Cook bacon until almost done.
2. Add onions and cook until translucent.

4. Combine remaining ingredients and add just enough water/broth to cover.
5. Simmer, stirring occasionally. About 20-25min.

## Notes
1. Salt may need to be added depending on the ingredients. Canned products, bacon, and soy will have added salt. But depending
on substitutions you may need to adjust.

2. You can add ground beef for extra bulk. Simply brown and drain 1/2lb of 85% ground beef and set aside. Then mix in after the onion/garlic has completed cooking.
